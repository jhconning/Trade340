# BB Welcome

Hi everyone,   

Welcome to our Spring 2021 Economics 100: Introduction to Economics. We'll meet for class Mondays and Thursdays 1:10-2:25pm.  Beginning  Monday 2/1, and for all subsequent  meetings, just click on this zoom link to join:

https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88951888201?pwd=UmE5OGdOZkJHZ05mY1ZVN0JxNitmZz09

Meeting ID: 889 5188 8201
Passcode: 340340

Or (same thing) download and start your zoom app and join with meeting ID 832 6843 0587 and (easy to remember) passcode 100100

We will use Tophat as our learning management system (LMS), not Blackboard.  If possible before class Monday (so you can participate in interactive polling and start to access all materials), please:


SIGN UP AT TOPHAT.COM and Enter Course Code 780702 when prompted to link to our course.
Choose the 7-Day Trial Account option.  Enter your name as it is listed on the course roster and enter your Hunter student ID if prompted (leave blank if unsure). Pricing information is provided below.
You'll find  course content and explanations on our tophat course site. Course content is organized by modules.  Module content will be released as the course proceeds but you can see the course structure in the syllabus.  The first module (after M00 Introduction) is M01 The Capitalist Revolution (with readings to help put our modern economy in historical context).
Tophat is a Canadian startup known for responsive support and innovative technology.  You should open up tophat in a browser tab (or, less ideally, on phone or tablet) prior to entering the zoom meeting so that you will be ready to respond if I start a polling question or game in class.  The platform will host and deliver


the e-textbook and other readings, slides, interactive apps, and other materials. Syllabus, study guides, etc.
Graded weekly online assignments, questions embedded in the readings,  and Student Gradebook.
Live polling, social experiments and graded questions during classroom.
Group and direct messaging between students, TAs, and myself via the 'community' platform.  This method is preferred over email.
We will not use Blackboard at all except for occasional email blasts (like this one).  

In a typical week, you will learn and get practice through a mix of asynchronous and synchronous instruction. You can expect to answer questions following readings or short videos, as well as a somewhat longer weekly assignment which you can complete on your own time.  You'll also respond to graded and ungraded polling questions during class, or participate in online games and experiments.  The Tophat site will make it very clear what content is assigned and due by when.  I will explain my grading policies (which do allow for some missed content without penalty) in class and on tophat.

We will have two experienced BAMA students as teaching assistants Azka and Abdullah.

Tophat Pricing

At the end of the 7-day trial (which Tophat has said will actually be more like 14 days for this class), Tophat will ask for $70 for continued access.  The price is broken down as $30 for the Tophat Pro platform (unless you already paid for another class) and $40 for the e-textbook and other original copyrighted content.   It will be cheapest to buy directly from Tophat. The Hunter Bookstore will offer to sell access codes but at a substantial markup, so only use this option the financial aid requires this payment method.  I wish it were less but this is already $50 less than the traditional commercial textbook packages we were using only a year ago.  

This email has been all about the mechanics of getting setup.  Get yourself on the tophat platform before Monday's class if you can and start exploring.   I look forward to explaining what the course will be about and seeing you in class soon.

Regards

Jonathan Conning
