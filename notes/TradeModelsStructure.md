# Trade Models Structure 

The Hecksher-Ohlin-Samuelson model (HOS), the Specific Factors Model (SFM) and the Ricardian Model (RM) share similar model structures. 

In the background we are making common assumptions about the **Demand Side** of the model, or consumer preferences (i.e. the utility $u(c_x, c_y)$ consumers obtain from each consumption bundle $(c_x, c_y)$). 

The **Supply Side** of each model is then defined by:
- Production Technology in each sector
- Resource constraints 

### The Hecksher-Ohlin-Samuelson Trade Model
$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_x &= F(K_x, L_x)   \\
Q_y &= G(K_y, L_y)    \\
\bar L &= L_x + L_y   \\
\bar K &= K_x + K_y 
\end{aligned}
$$


### The Specific Factors Model

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_x &= F(K_x, L_x)   \\
Q_y &= G(K_y, L_y)    \\
\bar L &= L_x + L_y  \\
K_x &= \bar K_x \\
K_y &= \bar K_y
\end{aligned}
$$


## The Ricardian Model

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_x &= MPL_x \cdot L_x  \\
Q_y &= MPL_y \cdot L_y   \\
\bar L &= L_x + L_y 
\end{aligned}
$$


## Notes
- Each model can be solved as a: 
  - **Social Planner's Problem:** 
    - **closed economy:** Social planner finds the point on the PPF that maximizes the value of a Social Welfare (a weighted average of consumer utility). With no world trade, the country must produce what it consumers.
    - **Open economy:** Social planner finds the point on the production function that maximizes country income at world prices and then chooses the point on the country's income line (or consumption possibility frontier) that maximizes the value of a social welfare function. 
  - **A Competitive Market:**
    - firms maximize profits and consumers sell factors to generate income to maximize consumption. In the **closed economy** domestic consumption must equal domestic production for each good; in the **open economy** only the value of production must equal the value of consumption (in a balanced trade economy).
- In HOS and SFM production technology is CRS of form $F(K,L)$. Capital and labor are substitutes in production. This leads to bowed out PPFs.
- The SFM as a short-run version of the HOS: in HOS both capital and labor can adjust across sectors but in SFM only labor can. 
- The RM is similar to the SFM (it's also known as the Ricardo-Viner model) in that only labor can adjust.  It also has simpler linear (constant marginal product of labor) production technologies. 
- The SFM model is also known as the Ricardo-Viner model due to its similarity to the Ricardian model: only labor can adjust.
- The RM is a "Classical" model in that relative prices and real wages are determined in the closed economy by the supply side of the economy only.
