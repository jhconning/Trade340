# topic_ Quotes etc


## Andrew's Greeks

There's a nice fragment from Plato's Republic, book II where they discuss the division of labor and trade. I thought maybe it could be included as a bit of "flavor text" in one of the future sections. 
 
370 c
>"Socrates - The result, then, is that more plentiful and better-quality goods are more easily produced if each person does one thing for which he is naturally suited, does it at the right time, and is released from having to do any of the others. 
 
. . .
 
>Socrates - Moreover, it's almost impossible to establish a city in a place where nothing has to be imported.
 
>Adeimantus - Indeed it is. 
 
>Socrates - So we'll need yet further people to import from other cities whatever is needed.
 
>A - Yes. 
 
>S - And if an importer goes empty-handed to another city, without a cargo of the things needed by the city from which he's to bring back what his own city needs, he'll come away empty-handed, won't he?
 
>A - So it seems. 
 
S - Therefore our citizens must not only produce enough for themselves at home but also goods of the right quality and quantity to satisfy the requirements of others."
 
What's interesting is that this little conversation takes place near the very beginning of the construction of the ideal city. For Plato/Socrates, it almost goes without saying that a city needs trade to survive. Interesting to see that even 2500 years ago they knew about gains from specialization.
