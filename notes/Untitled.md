Many of the trade models we study proceed as follows:

1. Find the **Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)** 

This tells us the efficient combinations of output of good $Q_x$, and of good $Q_Y$, that can be produced from given production technology in each sector and resource constraints.

If this is a closed economy then the economy must produce what it consumers (so $C_x=Q_x$ and $and the PPF can be, in effect, thought of as the country's budget set. 

2. **Closed Economy:** Find the production point
