Welcome to our Spring 2021 Economics 340: International Trade class at Hunter College.  I am looking forward to a terrific semester together.  

International Trade has always been one of my favorite classes.  As you'll soon discover engaging in "trade" is very similar to adoption a new 'technology,' so this is really a class about how technology, trade, the movement of factors of production such as labor and capital and other forces have transformed the world and impacted peoples lives.  

To understand this We'll need to dig not just into economists' micro- and macro- model toolkit but also study these issues in the context of economic history, political economy, and politics. This is inescapable because how societies adopt and adapt to trade and technology ultimately depends on how the benefits to one group are weighted against the costs to another, and whether and how one group compensates the other.  This is determined by a mix of political and market processes.  

Technological innovation, gains to greater specialization and trade, and the more easy flow of people, ideas and investment across borders have all certainly contributed to general rising standards of living.  But these processes can and have also been profoundly disruptive.  There are both winners and losers from change and therefore people will organize and fight politically to  try to support or challenge these policies.  

The pace of globalization picked up steam following a worldwide wave of policy liberalization, including the emergence of China as a world trading power, starting around the 1980s. New digital and industrial technologies arrived. These forces greatly expanded the flow of goods, services, capital and people across borders. New global supply chains emerged as large firms restructured and relocated production.  While hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty around the world as these new patterns of production and trade stimulated production and technological change, particularly in Asia, the income distribution and politics in the richer countries also became affected. Many observers have described the recent rise of new nationalist and populist political movements in Europe, the United States, and other countries as being driven, at least in part, by a 'backlash' against globalization.  

These are only some of topics and themes we will cover in the course.  

**About the course:** With over 60 students enrolled, we have a quie large class. We will use the [TopHat](https://app.tophat.com/e/054232) learning platform to host content and keep the course fun, participatory, and interactive.  You can expect to interact frequently via polling and simulation experiments in class sessions, via interactive homework exercises, videos that you can watch before or after class, and via discussion over messaging apps.
