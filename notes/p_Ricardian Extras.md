# p_Ricardian Extras

## Ricardian:  Extras and more advanced
What follows is optional reading.  Read if you are interested in a somewhat more technical and detailed treatment of the material.  


Building the PPF from a 4-quadrant diagram
To build a PPF in the Ricardian model we need just to specify the linear production technology in each sector, and the labor resource constraint.

 Q_x=MPL_x\cdot L_xQ 
x
​	
 =MPL 
x
​	
 ⋅L 
x
​	
  

 Q_y = MPL_y \cdot L_yQ 
y
​	
 =MPL 
y
​	
 ⋅L 
y
​	
  

 L_x + L_y = LL 
x
​	
 +L 
y
​	
 =L 

We can draw these relationships, and the production possibility frontier that together they imply on a four quadrant diagram like the one below.  Starting in the top right quadrant and moving clockwise, we label these quadrants I, II, III, and IV, respectively. 

Quadrant II:   We see the linear production function in the X sector.  Visualize  with L_xL 
x
​	
  ​ versus Q_xQ 
x
​	
  with  L_xL 
x
​	
  on the horizontal axis but then rotate that whole graphy clockwise 90 degrees.

Quadrant IV:   We see the linear production function in the Y sector.  Visualize a graph of with L_yL 
y
​	
 ​ ​versus Q_yQ 
y
​	
  but then flip  the graph around the vertical axis, so that L_yL 
y
​	
  runs from 0 to the left.

Quadrant III: This shows combinations of L_xL 
x
​	
  and  L_yL 
y
​	
  that satisfy the resource constraint.

Quadrant I:  Plots the PPF of Q_xQ 
x
​	
  versus Q_yQ 
y
​	
  

To understand how we can map out the PPF, let's work through an example.  Suppose we start with  L=20L=20 and production technology as in the geogebra app below.  We choose to allocate, say,  L_x=12L 
x
​	
 =12  units of labor to the X sector.  That tell us we will have L_y=L-L_x=20-12\;=\;8L 
y
​	
 =L−L 
x
​	
 =20−12=8 units left for production in the Y sector, and so we can determine Q_xQ 
x
​	
  and Q_yQ 
y
​	
  from the technologies above. 

Move the slider to step through all the possible starting values of L_xL 
x
​	
  to see how that traces out that fully tradces out the PPF.​
