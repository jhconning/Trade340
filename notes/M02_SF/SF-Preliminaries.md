# The Specific Factors Model

You will see things more clearly if you open the Geogebra source

**GEOGEBRA GOES HERE?**

## The Model

The Specific Factors Model is also often called the Ricardo-Viner model, after economist Jacob Viner who first articulated it most clearly.  Can you see, from the model below, why they also credit Ricardo with the ideas behind this model?

There are two goods produced in the economy, good X and good Y.  The economy has three factors a mobile labor workforce of  $\bar{L}$ workers that can move freely between the two sectors, and two types of capital that are specific to each sector. 

$$Q_x=F(L_x,\bar{T}_x)$$
$$Q_y=F(L_y,\bar{K}_y)$$
$$L_x+L_y=\bar{L}$$

The production functions are constant returns to scale and what we show above are industry-level production functions. We will think of each industry as having in fact hundreds of smaller firms that compete for factors in order to produce the product made in that sector, but since they all constant returns to scale production technology and face the same factor and product prices we can aggregate their behavior and represent their actions by the actions of a representative aggregate producer in the sector.

Suppose sector X represents agriculture.  Producers in this sector produce agricultural output using mobile labor and capital that is specific to the sector.  We might think of land as the specific factor in agriculture.  Farms in the agricultural sector might bid against each other for land, so that land will be competitively priced and free to move between different firms *within* the sector, but land cannot move *across* sectors. Land from Iowa cannot be moved to become capital in a factory in Detroit which is part of the manufactures sector. So the aggregate output from the sector will be $Q_x=F(L_x,\bar{T}_x)$ which depends on how much labor is demanded and used in the X sector, or $L_x$ as well as how much capital is used which is $\bar{T}_x$. We use the bar above variables to indicate this is the total inelastic supply of that factor in the economy.

The Y good might be manufacturing and here too we'd say competitive producers in that sector compete for mobile labor as well as for the capital specific to that sector (e.g. "machines").  

## Firm Factor Demands

Profit maximizing firms (farms) in the X sector take their product price $P_x$ and factor prices as given by the market. The factor price they have to pay labor is $w$ dollars per unit and the factor price they have to pay for land is $v$ dollars per unit of land (if they happen to own the land themselves, it's the same, $v$ measures the opportunity cost of that land, the rental rate they could have earned had they rented it out to others).  

$$\Pi(L_{xi},T_{xi})=P_x\cdot F(L_{xi},T_{xi})-w\cdot L_{xi}-v\cdot T_{xi}$$

As we've said, due to the CRS assumption, we can study the behavior of a single price-taking sector-wide firm as representing the choices facing any one of the many smaller firms in the sector.  Firms will maximize profits
