# p_Gradescope

I will ask you to upload scans of hand-written problem sets via a service called [gradescope.com](https://www.gradescope.com/).

## Instructions

- **Claim your gradescope account.**  You should've received an email at the address you use to signin to tophat. If not, no worries, just go to [gradescope.com](https://www.gradescope.com/) and setup an account using that email address.

- **Questions and instructions posted to Tophat** when a problem set is posted. 

- **Graph out your answers:**
   - **Use a simple template** like [this one](../attachments/twograph_template.pdf) with space for two answers per page.  You can either:
     - Print out the template if you have a printer. 
     - Use your own sheet (8.5x11 if available, any blank or notebook sheet if not).  Place the paper in portrait orientation, draw a horizontal line across the middle, and allow 1 inch margins. 
  - **Answer questions.** One answer on each half page.  Make sure all lines and writing is visible on the scan by using a dark (not blue!) pencil or pen. All axes and points should be clearly labeled as called for in the instructions.  
- **Scan your handwritten ansswers to PDF and upload**: 
   - Unless you have a scanner, the easiest method is to use a scanning app on your phone. Gradescope has app recommendations and instructions [here](https://help.gradescope.com/article/0chl25eed3-student-scan-mobile-device). Scanning apps allow you save the PDF to the phone, or send it to your computer (e.g. via email or cloud drive service).
   - Crop the image (using scanning app) to try to crop out any of the desk background around the page. Only the page you wrote on should be in the image.

- **Upload and submit your PDF**
  - **Login to gradescope.com,** open the indicated problem set, and upload the previously scanned PDF. 
  - Upon upload, gradescope will prompt you to identify which pages answer which questions. Follow instructions and submit. 
  - You'll later be able to see your upload with grades, grading rubric, and comments.
