## Krugman in Praise of Cheap Labor

- ""While fat-cat capitalists might benefit from globalization, the biggest beneficiaries are, yes, Third-World workers."

  I disagree with what he had said here, the biggest beneficiaries are Third-World *capitalists*. Businesses move their production to the third because it can cut costs and boost profits.  But labor in any part of the world cannot compete with the machines of the future.  Growth is entirely unequal and that we also know inequality is detrimental to future growth."

  - Factors of production; residual claimants.

  

  **Questions:**

- What happens to those countries that improve standards, but there is still a huge gap between poor and middle class? How does that get solved?
- Is it ethical to leave wage growth up to simple economic mechanics?
- Why is it impossible to think that offering better working conditions would NOT create a privileged aristocracy and would instead create a social and cultural ripple effect in which better working conditions and possibly higher wages are considered the norm? In this scenario, those who do experience the better working conditions and higher pay can pass on these practices when starting their own businesses domestically.

Why can't developing countries gain from trade?

- How can Globalization answer to the lack of gains in labor rights, human rights and environmental protection in the developing countries?

- Why is it that America was able to industrialize quite positively from low wages and terrible working conditions and these Third World countries still can't even if it is the better alternative to living on a heap of garbage?

- If we allow the workers in third world countries to work for such low wages, what reason do the leaders in those countries have to increase their wages if no one cares and they are making a profit?

  ANSWER: They can, things have improved.
