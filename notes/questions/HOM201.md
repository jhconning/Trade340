1. HOM201 In the 2-factor (labor and capital), 2 good Heckscher-Ohlin model (and assuming product prices remain constant), capital accumulation over time should:

*a. shift the production possibility curve outward and decrease the production of the labor-intensive product.
b. shift the production possibility curve outward, and increase the production of both goods.
c. shift the production possibility curve outward and only increase the production of the labor-intensive product.
d. move the point of production along the production possibility curve.
