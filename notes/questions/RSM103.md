1. RSM103 At about the 10:00 mark in the video, you will see Thomas has placed his self-made toaster on display in the store with a price tag of 1157 British pounds next to some other commercially made toasters (remember he took 9 months to reverse engineer a toaster that cost him 3.49 pounds to purchase).   Does 1157 british pounds adequately reflect all the costs of making that toaster?

a. It seems about right. Thomas added up the costs of all the raw materials and items that he had to purchase to make the toaster and it came out to that amount.
b. No, the cost seems way too high for that non-functioning toaster.
*c. No the cost seems way too low, for one it doesn't account for the opportunity cost of his time over nine months.
d. There's no way we can answer this question without further information.
