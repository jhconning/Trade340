# README

## Purpose
To systematically collect and create, organize questions for Eco 340 Trade class. 

## Main Steps
- Find or create new questions
- Enter questions into markdown notes 
   - Type directly or [convert](https://youtu.be/kQMumS6beOg) from other formats.
   - Link to relevant images in `../attachments` folder.
- [Tag the notes](TagSystem.md) for later use by topic, question type, difficulty, quality, when used, etc. 
- Push changes to [github.com/jhconning/questions340](https://github.com/jhconning/questions340) to keep under version control.
- Export notes in groups to upload questions into Tophat, making final adaptations there.

  

## Key Tools and Sites
- Markdown Editors/Organizers
  - [Notable app](https://notable.app/) - A markdown editor and very useful for tagging. Notable inserts Tags and other information into a YAML header at the top of each note. Use [insiders release](https://github.com/notable/) version to get advanced tagging and other features.
  - [Typora](https://typora.io4). A more full featured editor than notable (e.g. WYSIWYG editing) but doesn't support tagging. You can work on same note in Typora and Notable at same time.  Useful for getting a sense of what rendered question might look like and simplifies inserting tables and images.

## Folders and Repositories

- Github: to work collaboratively and keep materials under version control.
