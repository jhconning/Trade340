31. MAM102 Which of the following explanations is the most plausible explanation for why the United States has had a persistent trade deficit with the rest of the world over the past few decades.

*a. Because the United States has remained an attractive destination for investment from abroad, driving expenditure (E = C + I + G) above domestic output Y. 
b. Because wages are lower abroad than in the USA so US firms find it difficult to compete. 
c. Because other countries have been taking advantage of the USA by having higher tariffs on their products.
d. Because we have been losing ‘competitiveness’ as other countries have increased their productivity faster than the USA has.
