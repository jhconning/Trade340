24. TPM104 Suppose Harley Davidson assembles and sells motorcycles in the USA for $10,000 a unit using imported steel and other components from Canada costing $4000. There is no tariff on these intermediate components so value added at world prices is equal to $5000. Consider now two scenarios (A) the USA imposes a 25% tariff on final good motorcycles and on intermediate components; and (B) The USA imposes a 25% tariff on motorcycle components only (zero tariff on imported motorcycles).  We can calculate the effective rate of protection ERP in scenarios A and B to be ____________ respectively.

a. 25% and 40%
*b. 25% and -25%
c. 40% and -20%
d. 25% and -20%
