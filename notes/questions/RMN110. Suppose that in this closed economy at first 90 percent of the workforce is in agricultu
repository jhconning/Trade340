1. RMN110  Continuing with question RMN109. Suppose that in this closed economy at first 90 percent of the workforce is in agriculture and manufacturing. Labor markets are competitive and every worker earns a wage w.  What is the real wage of a worker, measured in terms of agricultural meals per day?  That is what is w/Pa?   Enter only a number  (Hint: competitition on labor markets will guarantee that in equlibrium a worker can earn the same nominal wage working in either sector, equal to the marginal value product of a laborer in each sector,  Pa*MPLa = w = Pm*MPLm.  Use the left side of this equation to find how many meals a day a worker can afford with this wage)
