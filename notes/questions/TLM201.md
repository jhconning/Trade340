1. TLM201 Think of labor demand by firms in a sector (given by the horizontal summation of each firmâ€™s downward sloping marginal value product of labor (P*MPL). If the product price remains unchanged then an improvement that raises the marginal product of every worker by say 10% should lead to _________ in labor demand and employment in the sector. However if the resulting increase in output supply leads to a sufficiently large ________ in the product price then total employment in the sector could fall:

a. an increase, increase
b. a decrease; increase
c. no change; fall
*d. an increase; fall

[^comment]: the demand for labor curve is P*MPL so all this is saying is that if P falls faster than MPL goes up the curve shifts down
