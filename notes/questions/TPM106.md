1. TPM106 The economy produces agricultural goods and manufacturing goods only. Assuming no market failures free trade is the first-best policy. Which of the following production subsidies or taxes creates the least distortion (assume monies for subsidies as well as any revenues from taxes are raised or returned to citizens in non-distorting fashion):

a. A production quota (with a 20% tariff equivalent) on good X.
b. A 20% tariff on the importation of good X
*c. A 20% production subsidy to good X
d. A 20% production subsidy and a 20% consumption tax on good X

[^comment]: all the others distort more
because have production subsidy + consumption tax implications
