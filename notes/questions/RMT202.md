1. RMN203 Consider the economy depicted by the PPF below which produces television sets and cars. Suppose we know MPLc = 2 cars per worker.  Suppose now this closed economy opens up to trade and that the world relative price of TVs is 3 cars per TV.  In the closed economy a workers real wage measured in terms of cars  w/Pc = MPLc = 2 cars per worker. What will be a workers real wage once the economy opens to trade?

Another method.  

Each worker earns a real wage 
wage w/Pt = MPLt =
