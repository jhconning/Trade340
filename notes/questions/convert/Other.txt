31. MAM102 Which of the following explanations is the most plausible explanation for why the United States has had a persistent trade deficit with the rest of the world over the past few decades.

28. PEM101 Economist Dani Rodrik writes “Today the advanced countries [that are] most exposed to the international economy are also those where safety nets and social insurance programs – welfare states – are the most extensive.” Workers in the USA, he argues enjoyed until recently ‘considerable protection from imports, especially from low-wage countries [due to the US] large domestic market and relative geographical insulation.’ The USA traditionally had ‘a weak welfare state’ but this he claims now makes the US vulnerable to the rise of populist protectionist policies as workers have become more exposed to trade in recent decades. Why would there is a connection? Because

a. exposure to immigration exposes countries to socialist ideas.
b. richer countries can afford to spend more on social programs.
*c. safety net programs limit workers exposure to trade-related losses and redistribute some of the gains to trade in ways that maintain political support for open trade policies.
d. he argues this happened by pure chance but it now affects country’s attitudes to trade.
30. PEM102 According to economist Dani Rodrik and some other authors, countries that are more exposed to trade (measured for example as (X + M) / GDP ) also tend to have

a. high levels of trade protection

1. TLM101 In the simplest intra-industry trade model with increasing returns and monopolistic competition, which happens

a. the total number of varieties produced in each country increases and prices fall.
*b. consumers gain from more product varieties sold, prices fall and real wages rise so welfare rises for all workers.
c. real wages rise in the larger country and fall in the smaller.
d. national income increases but income inequality worsens.
27. TLM201 Think of total labor demand by firms in a sector (the horizontal summation of each firm’s downward sloping marginal value product of labor, P*MPL).  If the product price remains unchanged then a generalized technological improvement that raises the marginal product of every worker by say 10% should lead to _________ in labor demand and employment in the sector. However if the resulting increase in output supply leads to a sufficiently large ________ in the product price then total employment in the sector could fall:

a. an increase, increase 
b. a decrease; increase
c. no change; fall
*d. an increase; fall
1. TLM201 Think of labor demand by firms in a sector (given by the horizontal summation of each firm’s downward sloping marginal value product of labor (P*MPL). If the product price remains unchanged then an improvement that raises the marginal product of every worker by say 10% should lead to _________ in labor demand and employment in the sector. However if the resulting increase in output supply leads to a sufficiently large ________ in the product price then total employment in the sector could fall:

a. an increase, increase
b. a decrease; increase
c. no change; fall
*d. an increase; fall

[^comment]: the demand for labor curve is P*MPL so all this is saying is that if P falls faster than MPL goes up the curve shifts down

d. 0%
24. TPM104 Suppose Harley Davidson assembles and sells motorcycles in the USA for $10,000 a unit using imported steel and other components from Canada costing $4000. There is no tariff on these intermediate components so value added at world prices is equal to $5000. Consider now two scenarios (A) the USA imposes a 25% tariff on final good motorcycles and on intermediate components; and (B) The USA imposes a 25% tariff on motorcycle components only (zero tariff on imported motorcycles).  We can calculate the effective rate of protection ERP in scenarios A and B to be ____________ respectively.

a. 25% and 40%
*b. 25% and -25%
c. 40% and -20%
d. 25% and -20%

a. A 10 % consumption tax on both the imported and domestically produced good
b. A 10 % production subsidy on the domestically produced good
*c. The combination of a. and b.
d. A 10% wage subsidy to workers in the domestic production of that good.
1. TPM106 The economy produces agricultural goods and manufacturing goods only. Assuming no market failures free trade is the first-best policy.

b. A 20% tariff on the importation of good X
*c. A 20% production subsidy to good X
d. A 20% production subsidy and a 20% consumption tax on good X

[^comment]: all the others distort more
because have production subsidy + consumption tax implications

a. An increase in the world market price of corn
*b. An increase in the domestic price of corn
c. A reduction of corn exports
