1. RMM109 In the Ricardian model when a country requires fewer resources to produce a given level of output of a product compared to other countries, it is said to have a(n):

1. RMM113 Assume a Ricardian model with fixed labor requirements in which the United States had an absolute advantage in both industries compared to Mexico. Mexico is specialized in producing Avocados and the US is specialized in producing SUV trucks.  Suppose now that Mexican workers in both Avocados and the Mexican SUV truck sector improve their productivity (US productivity unchanged). The pattern of comparative advantage does not change.  The expected effect includes:

a. US workers real wages fall as they face increased competition from now more productive Mexican labor
*b. Relative product prices change and US workers real wages increase
c. Mexican workers become unemployed and Mexican wages fall as higher productivity renders many workers redundant. 
d. The rental rate of capital in Mexico rises.
1. RMM114 Suppose an economy produces two goods: food and machines. This economy always operates on its production possibilities frontier. Last year, it produced 50 units of food and 30 machines.

*a. An increase in emigration (people leaving the country)
b. An increase in the labor force
c. An improvement in technology
d. An increase in worker productivity
