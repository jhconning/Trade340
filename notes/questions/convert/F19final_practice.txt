a. Rise in the developing country and Fall in the developed
b. Fall in the developing country and rise in the developed
c. Fall in both countries
d. Rise in both countries

d. all of the above
11. Think of labor demand by firms in a sector (given by the horizontal summation of each firm’s downward sloping marginal value product of labor (P*MPL). If the product price remains unchanged then an improvement that raises the marginal product of every worker by say 10% should lead to _________ in labor demand and employment in the sector. However if the resulting increase in output supply leads to a sufficiently large ________ in the product price then total employment in the sector could fall:
a. an increase, increase
b. a decrease; increase
c. no change; fall
d. an increase; fall
12. Which of the following international organizations today is responsible for developing and maintaining the system of international trade rules and dealing with trade disputes?

c. The Generalized Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
d. The WTO
13. Which of the following explanations is the most plausible explanation for why the United States has had a persistent trade deficit with the rest of the world over the past few decades.
a. Because the United States has remained an attractive destination for investment from abroad, driving expenditure (E = C + I + G) above domestic output Y.
b. Because wages are lower abroad than in the USA so US firms find it difficult to compete.
c. Because other countries have been taking advantage of the USA by having higher tariffs on their products.
d. Because we have been losing ‘competitiveness’ as other countries have increased their productivity faster than the USA has.
