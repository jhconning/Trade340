1. In the Ricardian model when a country requires fewer resources to produce a given level of output of a product compared to other countries, it is said to have a(n):
a. Lower opportunity cost of producing the product
b. Higher opportunity cost of producing the product
c. An absolute advantage in the production of the product
d. A comparative advantage in product’s production
2. What is the marginal product of labor?
a. the total output obtained by using one more unit of labor
b. the total output divided by total amount of labor input 
c. the extra output obtained by using one more unit of labor
d. the product price multiplied by the average product of labor
3. In the Ricardian model the slope of the PPF can be expressed as: 
a. the ratio of the marginal products of labor in producing each good
b. the ratio of the quantities of good 1 and good 2.
c. the ratio of total capital to labor.
d. Price times the average marginal product of labor between the two sectors
4. Compared to no-trade, international trade allows countries to:
a. Produce outside their PPF
b. Consume outside their PPF
c. Both of the above
d. Produce inside their PPF
5. Suppose the marginal product of a worker is  MPLB = 14 bunches of bananas per worker per day and the country is specialized in the production of Bananas.  The country exchanges Bananas for Gadgets at world relative price or   gadgets per banana.  What is  , the real wage of a worker (measured in gadgets purchasing power)?
a. 7 gadgets per day
b. 14 gadgets per day
c. 28 gadgets per day
d. 2 gadgets per day
6. Suppose that there are two factors, capital and land, and that the United States is relatively land endowed while the European Union is relatively capital-endowed. According to the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS) model
a. all capitalists in both countries should support free trade.
b. the U.S. should compensate European countries once trade commences.
c. Europe landowners should support free trade.
d. all landowners should support free trade.
e. European capitalists should support free trade.
7. In the two-country model of international labor mobility (think SFM but for migration between the ‘North’ and the ‘South’)
a. migration has no effect on global output, though some groups are made worse off.
b. migration increases global output, makes some groups worse off.
c. migration may reduce global output, some groups are made better off.
d. migration results in increased global output, and all groups are made better off.
8. The PPF of a country will be skewed toward that good that:
a. uses its intensive factor abundantly.
b. uses its scarce factor intensively.
c. Uses its abundant factor intensively
d. Does not use its intensive factor abundantly.
9. According to the graph (which shows Home and Foreign in autarky), which nation has a higher no-trade relative price for computers (in terms of shoes)?
a. Home
b. Foreign
c. Both countries have the same relative price
d. Cannot tell without knowing more about consumer preferences.
10. Assume a Ricardian model with fixed labor requirements in which the United States had an absolute advantage in both industries compared to Mexico. Mexico is specialized in producing Avocados and the US is specialized in producing SUV trucks.  Suppose now that Mexican workers in both Avocados and the Mexican SUV truck sector improve their productivity (US productivity unchanged). The pattern of comparative advantage does not change.  The expected effect includes:
a. US workers real wages fall as they face increased competition from now more productive Mexican labor
b. Relative product prices change and US workers real wages increase
c. Mexican workers become unemployed and Mexican wages fall as higher productivity renders many workers redundant. 
d. The rental rate of capital in Mexico rises.
11. The evidence from the ‘China Shock’ papers by Autor and his co-researchers found geographically persistent impacts of a surge of Chinese imports.  This is most consistent with the evidence from which of the following models:
a. Ricardian
b. Specific Factors
c. Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson
d. IRS with monopolistic competition
12. The effects of a 10% import tariff on a good is similar to:
a. A 10 % consumption tax on both the imported and domestically produced good
b. A 10 % production subsidy on the domestically produced good
c. The combination of a. and b.
d. A 10% wage subsidy to workers in the domestic production of that good.
13. According to economic historians Engerman and Sokoloff which place in the Americas (described today with their modern day names) had the highest average per-capita output in 1790 (hint: which region had the highest marginal value productivity per worker)?
a. Britain      
b. USA.    
c. Mexico     
d. Haiti
