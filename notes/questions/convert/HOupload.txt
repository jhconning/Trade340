a.monopolization
b. entropy
c. divergence
*d. convergence

1. HOM201 In the 2-factor (labor and capital), 2 good Heckscher-Ohlin model (and assuming product prices remain constant), capital accumulation over time should:

b. shift the production possibility curve outward, and increase the production of both goods.
c. shift the production possibility curve outward and only increase the production of the labor-intensive product.
d. move the point of production along the production possibility curve.
