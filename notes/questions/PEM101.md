28. PEM101 Economist Dani Rodrik writes “Today the advanced countries [that are] most exposed to the international economy are also those where safety nets and social insurance programs – welfare states – are the most extensive.” Workers in the USA, he argues enjoyed until recently ‘considerable protection from imports, especially from low-wage countries [due to the US] large domestic market and relative geographical insulation.’ The USA traditionally had ‘a weak welfare state’ but this he claims now makes the US vulnerable to the rise of populist protectionist policies as workers have become more exposed to trade in recent decades. Why would there is a connection? Because

a. exposure to immigration exposes countries to socialist ideas.
b. richer countries can afford to spend more on social programs.
*c. safety net programs limit workers exposure to trade-related losses and redistribute some of the gains to trade in ways that maintain political support for open trade policies.
d. he argues this happened by pure chance but it now affects country’s attitudes to trade.
