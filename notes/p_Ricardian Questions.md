## The Ricardian Model Questions

For some of the questions below you may find it useful to refer to this geogebra applet. Move the sliders to change the model parameters. You can find the original geogebra code [here](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/mwmw6pxw).

Production and (marginal) labor productivity
Each sector has a simple production technology.  For example the X sector has the production function

 $$Q_X=MPL_X \cdot L_X$$
  

Each worker in the sector has a constant marginal product of labor of $MPL_X$ 

​	
  units of output of good X per worker.   So if, for example MPL_X=MPL 
X
​	
 = 2 units of good X per unit of labor, and we applied say L_X=6L 
X
​	
 =6 units of labor into the sector we would get an output level of Q_XQ 
X
​	
  

This says that if you input say L_X=6L 
X
​	
 =6 units of labor into the sector it will produce Q_X = 2 \cdot 6 =12Q 
X
​	
 =2⋅6=12 units of good X.  

Unit Labor requirements
We measure MPL_XMPL 
X
​	
  in units of good X per unit of labor.   It follows that its reciprocal  \frac{1}{MPL_X} 
MPL 
X
​	
 
1
​	
  must be measured in units of labor per unit of good X.   We call this the unit labor requirement (and many texts represent by as a_{LX}a 
LX
​	
 ).  It tells us how much labor we need to produce one unit of good X.   Since the one is the reciprocal of the other, it doesn't really matter if we summarize the technology by the marginal productivity of the worker, or the unit labor requirement for the production of that good... they convey the same information.

To give a concrete example.   If a worker can produce MPL_X=2MPL 
X
​	
 =2 units of X per hour, it follows that it will talke takes 1/2 a worker to to produce one unit of X.
