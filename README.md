# Econ 340: International Trade
## (Spring 2021)

This site is used to organize content for the Eco 340 course site on Tophat.

Most of the content is written in markdown (.md) and jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files and then rendered as a jupyterbook website: 

[jhconning.github.io/trade340/](https://jhconning.github.io/trade340/)

The virtue of this method is that it allows us to do a 'mock up' of content very similar to what things will look like in the Tophat site.  

The disadvantage of editing files directly on Tophat is that they cannot be placed under version control and Tophat uses proprietary file formats/editing tools that make it very difficult to recover content once pasted in.

Hence the logic of editing content here and then pasting in final content.
